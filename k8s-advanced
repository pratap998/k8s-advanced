Advanced Kubernetes Hands-On Roadmap
🔹 Step 1 – Advanced Workloads
1.	DaemonSets
o	Deploy a logging agent (Fluentd/Node Exporter) using a DaemonSet.
o	Verify it runs on every node.
2.	Jobs & CronJobs
o	Create a Job that runs a batch script (echo Hello + sleep).
o	Create a CronJob that runs every 2 minutes and writes logs to a PVC.
3.	StatefulSets
o	Deploy a Redis cluster with StatefulSets + Headless Service.
o	Observe pod ordering and persistent volume claim behavior.
4.	Pod Disruption Budgets
o	Define a PDB that ensures at least 1 pod is always running during drain.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 2 – Scheduling & Node Placement
1.	Taints & Tolerations
o	Taint one node as dedicated=cache:NoSchedule.
o	Run only Redis pods on that node using tolerations.
2.	Node Affinity / Anti-Affinity
o	Ensure two Nginx pods do not run on the same node.
3.	Topology Spread Constraints
o	Deploy 6 pods across 3 nodes, spread evenly.
4.	Custom Scheduler
o	Install a second scheduler and assign specific pods to it.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 3 – Networking Deep Dive
1.	Headless Service
o	Deploy MySQL with StatefulSet + Headless Service.
o	Verify DNS resolves to individual pod IPs.
2.	Network Policies
o	Block pod-to-pod communication except for allowed namespaces.
3.	Ingress Controllers
o	Install NGINX Ingress Controller.
o	Route /app1 → Nginx pod, /app2 → Apache pod.
4.	Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
o	Install Istio.
o	Enable traffic splitting: 90% → v1, 10% → v2.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 4 – Storage
1.	Dynamic Provisioning
o	Create a StorageClass (EBS or Azure Disk).
o	Deploy a PVC + Pod that mounts it.
2.	Volume Snapshots
o	Take a snapshot of a PVC, clone it into another PVC.
3.	Stateful Storage
o	Deploy a PostgreSQL StatefulSet with persistent volumes.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 5 – Security
1.	RBAC
o	Create a role that can only get, list pods in one namespace.
o	Bind it to a developer user.
2.	Pod Security Admission
o	Enforce a namespace where only non-root containers run.
3.	Secrets
o	Use Kubernetes Secrets for DB passwords.
o	Integrate SealedSecrets or External Secrets Operator.
4.	Admission Controllers
o	Install Kyverno/OPA Gatekeeper → enforce “no container runs as root”.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 6 – Scaling & Performance
1.	HPA
o	Create a Deployment with Nginx.
o	Use kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 + ab (Apache Bench) to stress test.
o	Watch HPA scale pods.
2.	VPA
o	Deploy a pod with low CPU request.
o	Enable VPA to auto-adjust resources.
3.	Cluster Autoscaler
o	On cloud (EKS/AKS/GKE), configure autoscaler to add/remove nodes.
4.	Resource Quotas
o	Apply namespace-level quotas for dev/test teams.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 7 – Monitoring & Logging
1.	Prometheus + Grafana
o	Install via Helm.
o	Scrape K8s metrics + visualize in Grafana.
2.	EFK Stack
o	Deploy Elasticsearch + Fluentd + Kibana.
o	Verify pod logs are collected.
3.	Tracing
o	Add Jaeger to a sample microservice.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 8 – Upgrades & Reliability
1.	Rolling Updates
o	Deploy a sample app with image: v1.
o	Update to v2 with maxUnavailable=0, maxSurge=1.
2.	Blue-Green Deployment
o	Deploy v1 on Service A, v2 on Service B.
o	Switch traffic using Ingress.
3.	Canary Release
o	Route 10% traffic to v2 using Istio.
4.	Cluster Upgrade
o	Simulate control-plane/node upgrade on Minikube.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 9 – Configuration & GitOps
1.	Helm
o	Package an app into a Helm chart.
o	Version and deploy it.
2.	Kustomize
o	Apply overlays (dev, test, prod) to same base YAML.
3.	Operators
o	Deploy a MySQL Operator to manage DB lifecycle.
4.	GitOps (ArgoCD)
o	Sync app from Git repo → cluster automatically.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 10 – Debugging & Chaos Engineering
1.	kubectl debug
o	Attach an ephemeral container for troubleshooting.
2.	Chaos Engineering
o	Install LitmusChaos.
o	Kill random pods/nodes → check recovery.
3.	K9s / Lens
o	Manage/debug cluster with advanced tools.

👉 If you follow this roadmap, by the end you’ll be at production-grade Kubernetes level 💯
Would you like me to prepare this roadmap as a structured PDF/Workbook with YAML examples for each step (so you can directly try them in your cluster)?
